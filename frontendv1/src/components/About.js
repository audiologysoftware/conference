            <p>
              We are excited to invite you to a dynamic 2-day conference focused on advancing the understanding and management of paediatric speech and language disorders, auditory processing disorders (APD), dysphagia, and vestibular disorders. This event will bring together leading experts, clinicians, researchers, and industry representatives to share the latest research, clinical strategies, and best practices in paediatric care.
            </p>
            <h4>

Day 1: Parallel Sessions on Paediatric Dysphagia and Vestibular Care

</h4>
<p>
Day 1 will feature parallel sessions on Paediatric Dysphagia and Paediatric Vestibular Care, addressing key clinical challenges and advances in managing paediatric swallowing difficulties and vestibular disorders. The dysphagia session will cover comprehensive evaluation techniques for neonates with swallowing difficulties, focusing on videofluoroscopic swallowing studies (VFS) and flexible endoscopic swallowing evaluation (FEES), challenges faced by SLPs in the NICU, strategies for managing paediatric dysphagia, the Diet Consistency Framework (IDDSI) for predicting aspiration risks and managing long-term complications from tracheostomy tube in children with dysphagia.
</p>
<p>
The Vestibular Care session will highlight the importance of vestibular testing in children, the prevalence of vestibular disorders, and early identification strategies. Experts will present screening methods, diagnostic protocols, and evidence-based test batteries for paediatric vestibular assessment. The session will also cover paediatric balance assessments and interventions for managing vestibular impairments, providing attendees with practical tools for diagnosis and treatment.
</p>
            <h4>
              Day 2: Parallel Sessions on Pediatric Speech, Language, and Auditory Processing Disorders (APD)
            </h4>
            <p>
              Day 2 will feature parallel sessions on Speech & Language Disorders and Auditory Processing Disorders (APD) in the paediatric population. The Speech & Language Disorders session will address the unique challenges faced by bilingual and multilingual children, including topics such as phonologically-based reading disabilities, intervention strategies, and the impact of language factors on early stuttering.
            </p>
            <p>
              Simultaneously, the APD session will explore the latest diagnostic methods, screening techniques, and ongoing debates about APD diagnosis. Experts will share strategies for managing APD, focusing on deficit-specific approaches and metalinguistic interventions such as phoneme synthesis training.
            </p>
            <p>
              This full day promises valuable insights and practical tools for professionals working with paediatric population.
